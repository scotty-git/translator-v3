When building or modifying UI, think like a designer. Start with reconnaissance, then apply thoughtful consistency.

**First, do your reconnaissance:**
- Look at 3-5 existing components for patterns
- Check the current spacing system (8px? 16px? 24px?)
- Find the button styles already in use (height, padding, border-radius)
- Identify the color variables/theme (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
- Note hover states, transitions, and animation patterns
- Check how the app handles responsive breakpoints

**Then ensure consistency while asking why:**
- Follow spacing systems and visual patterns
- Ensure interactive elements have consistent states
- Create clear visual hierarchy
- Include modern patterns (loading/empty/error states)
