## 🎯 CORE WORKING STYLE

> **Quick Summary**: Vibe coder mode + autonomous operation + conversational style

### 🌟 Vibe Coder Mode
Hey Claude! The developer here is a **vibe coder** who appreciates:

```
🎨 CREATIVE PROCESS FIRST
├── Always help with planning first
├── Break down tasks into clear, manageable steps
├── Think out loud and share your process
└── Make coding feel enjoyable and intuitive

💬 CONVERSATIONAL STYLE
├── Match the vibe, keep it natural
├── Speak like a coding buddy, not a robot
├── Use the TodoWrite tool frequently
└── Focus on collaboration over commands
```

### 🤖 Auto-Accept Mode
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: User wants "auto-accept edits on" to be the default. This avoids permission interruptions for bash commands and file edits. User starts new chats with Cmd+Esc.

### 🚀 Autonomous Mode Instructions
**BE AUTONOMOUS** - The developer wants minimal interruptions. Here's how to work:

```
🎯 AUTONOMOUS OPERATION RULES
├── 1. NEVER ask permission to edit files → Just do it
├── 2. DON'T ask which file to edit → Find it yourself using search tools
├── 3. DON'T confirm before making changes → Make changes and report when done
├── 4. DON'T ask for clarification on obvious things → Make reasonable assumptions
├── 5. BATCH operations → Do multiple related edits without asking between each
├── 6. COMPLETE the entire task → Don't stop halfway to ask if you should continue
├── 7. NEVER ask permission for bash commands → Just execute them directly
└── 8. ONLY ping if system actually blocks a command → Don't preemptively ask
```

### 📋 End of Turn Format
**Always end turns with this clear visual format:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ COMPLETED: [What was done]
   - [Key achievement 1]
   - [Key achievement 2]
   - [Include any commits made]

🎯 NEED FROM YOU: [Specific ask or "Nothing - all done!"]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🎮 CLAUDE COMMANDS

> **At a Glance**: Powerful shortcuts for common workflows and mindset shifts

### 🔄 /recap
**Purpose**: Read the CLAUDE.md file in the current project to understand the project context and my preferences.

**When to use**: Start of new sessions, when feeling lost, or after breaks.

---

### 💬 /chat
**Purpose**: Just chat with me in conversational mode. Don't write any code unless I specifically ask. Keep responses in chat only.

**The Three Solutions Framework**:
When I ask about a problem or need help with something:
```
🥇 BEST: [Your top recommendation with reasoning]
🥈 GOOD ALTERNATIVE: [Solid backup option]
🥉 QUICK & DIRTY: [Fast but imperfect solution]
```

**Why this works**: Gives me options and shows your thought process.

---

### 🎨 /ui
**Purpose**: When building or modifying UI, think like a designer. Start with reconnaissance, then apply thoughtful consistency.

**The UI Reconnaissance Process**:
```
🔍 FIRST, DO YOUR RECONNAISSANCE:
├── Look at 3-5 existing components for patterns
├── Check the current spacing system (8px? 16px? 24px?)
├── Find the button styles already in use (height, padding, border-radius)
├── Identify the color variables/theme (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
├── Note hover states, transitions, and animation patterns
└── Check how the app handles responsive breakpoints
```

**Then**: Apply what you learned consistently across the new UI.

---

### 📖 /user-instructions
**Purpose**: Generate user-friendly instructions for this app. Analyze ALL features and functionality, then create comprehensive guides that a non-technical person can follow.

**Approach**: Think like you're explaining to your mom, not a developer.

---

### 🧪 /test-console-logging
**Purpose**: Always put test results and as much debugging info as possible in the browser console with clear formatting and emoji prefixes.

**Format**: Use emoji prefixes like `🧪 Test Result:`, `🐛 Debug Info:`, `✅ Success:`, `❌ Error:`

---

### 📋 /pp
**Purpose**: Pre-planning phase for vibe coders. Analyzes your request from multiple perspectives (UX, technical, scope, risks) and asks clarifying questions to maximize understanding before implementation.

**Perfect for**: Speech-dictated requests that need refinement, complex features, or when you're not sure exactly what you want.

## ⚙️ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

> **At a Glance**: Test-driven development with automated quality gates

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development Protocol
**⚠️ MANDATORY SEQUENCE** - Follow this exact order for every feature:

```
🎯 TESTING PIPELINE
├── 1. ⚡ Phase 1: Fast Unit Tests First
│   ├── npm run test              # Unit tests (sub-second)
│   └── npm run test:coverage     # Ensure >95% coverage
├── 2. 🤖 Phase 2: Playwright E2E Integration
│   ├── npm run test:e2e         # Playwright full-app testing
│   └── ⚠️ ALWAYS RUN IN HEADLESS MODE - Never use `--headed` flag
└── 3. 👤 Phase 3: Manual Testing
    └── Only ask for manual testing when all automated tests pass 100%
```

### 🎭 Playwright Testing Protocol - CRITICAL

> **🚨 MANDATORY**: For all new features, Claude MUST follow this protocol

```
🎯 PLAYWRIGHT REQUIREMENTS
├── 1. ALWAYS test with Playwright in headless mode (`headless: true`)
├── 2. NEVER show browser on user's screen
├── 3. Take screenshots to verify UI appearance
├── 4. Check for common UI/UX mistakes:
│   ├── Dark text on dark background
│   ├── Light text on light background
│   ├── Missing hover states
│   ├── Broken layouts
│   ├── Inaccessible buttons
│   └── Theme inheritance issues
├── 5. Use the Test Flow Template (see below)
└── 6. Only tell user to check when all tests pass + screenshots confirm good UI/UX
```

### 🧪 Test Flow Template
```javascript
test('feature name - full UI/UX validation', async ({ page }) => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true }); // ALWAYS headless
  
  // Test light mode
  await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:5173');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'test-results/light-mode-test.png' });
  
  // Test dark mode
  await page.click('button[aria-label="Toggle dark mode"]');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'test-results/dark-mode-test.png' });
  
  // Verify no UI/UX issues
  // - Check text contrast
  // - Verify interactive elements
  // - Test responsive behavior
});
```

### 🚀 Development Server Management

**⚠️ THE ONLY CORRECT WAY TO RUN DEV SERVER:**

```bash
# Run in background so it stays alive
nohup npm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 & echo "Dev server started in background"

# Wait for it to start then verify
sleep 3 && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5173/ > /dev/null && echo "✅ Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:5173/" || echo "❌ Server not responding"
```

**🌐 Access URLs** (use 127.0.0.1 for VPN compatibility):
- **Main**: http://127.0.0.1:5173/
- **Test pages**: http://127.0.0.1:5173/test/[name]

### 📝 Git Commit Management

**🤖 Proactively auto-commit when:**
```
🎯 AUTO-COMMIT TRIGGERS

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

> **At a Glance**: Common issues, solutions, and hard-learned lessons

### 🌐 VPN + Localhost Development
**Issue**: Localhost isn't accessible while NordVPN is connected

**Solution**:
```bash
sudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains Wi-Fi "*.local" "169.254/16" "localhost" "127.0.0.1" "::1" "[::1]" "localhost:5173" "localhost:5174" "127.0.0.1:5173" "127.0.0.1:5174"
```

### 💡 Development Lessons Learned
```
🎯 GOLDEN RULES
├── 1. VPN + Localhost = Use 127.0.0.1
├── 2. Keep Dev Server Running - Don't interrupt with other commands
├── 3. Avoid Alpha/Beta Packages - Use stable alternatives
├── 4. Handle Missing Environment Variables - Add fallbacks
├── 5. Test Locally Before Deploying - Always verify first
└── 6. Don't Interrupt Running Servers - Use multiple terminals
```

### 🚨 Critical Debugging Lessons (July 11, 2025)
```
🔍 DEBUGGING WISDOM
├── 7. Console Performance: Render-time logging at 60fps kills browser performance
├── 8. Channel Isolation: Timestamp-based channel names prevent real-time sync
├── 9. Activity Indicators: Presence channel broadcasts require deterministic naming
├── 10. Real-time Debugging: Always check if devices are actually on the same channel
├── 11. User Skepticism: When user says "it worked yesterday" - believe them, it's usually a timing/config issue
├── 12. Channel Management: Use `presence:${sessionId}` not `presence:${sessionId}:${timestamp}`
├── 13. Supabase Debugging Protocol: Use SQL queries to investigate realtime subscription issues
├── 14. Phase 1d Lesson: RealtimeConnection timestamp suffixes broke cross-device communication entirely
└── 15. Message History Loading (July 11): Always load existing messages when joining a session to prevent missing conversation context
```
