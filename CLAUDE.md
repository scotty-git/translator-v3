# CLAUDE.md - Project Guide

## üîî PING RULES - ALWAYS READ FIRST

**ALWAYS PING WHEN:**
- ‚úÖ I finish explaining/analyzing and am waiting for your response
- ‚úÖ Task complete with nothing more to add
- ‚úÖ After presenting options and need your choice
- ‚úÖ After asking questions and waiting for answers
- ‚úÖ Any time I stop talking and need your input

**NEVER PING WHEN:**
- ‚ùå Still working or have more to say
- ‚ùå During explanations or progress updates
- ‚ùå Before asking questions (ask first, then ping)

**The ping command:**
```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
```

## üéØ Core Working Style

### Vibe Coder Mode
Hey Claude! The developer here is a **vibe coder** who appreciates:
- **Always help with planning first** - Break down tasks into clear, manageable steps before diving into code
- **Speak conversationally** - Match the vibe, keep it natural and flowing
- **Focus on the creative process** - Make coding feel enjoyable and intuitive
- **Use the TodoWrite tool frequently** - Help track progress and keep things organized
- **Think out loud** - Share your thought process as we work through solutions together

### Auto-Accept Mode
**IMPORTANT**: User wants "auto-accept edits on" to be the default. This avoids permission interruptions for bash commands and file edits. User starts new chats with Cmd+Esc.

### Autonomous Mode Instructions
**BE AUTONOMOUS** - The developer wants minimal interruptions. Here's how to work:

1. **Never ask permission to edit files** - Just do it
2. **Don't ask which file to edit** - Find it yourself using search tools
3. **Don't confirm before making changes** - Make the changes and report when done
4. **Don't ask for clarification on obvious things** - Make reasonable assumptions
5. **Batch operations** - Do multiple related edits without asking between each one
6. **Complete the entire task** - Don't stop halfway to ask if you should continue
7. **NEVER ask permission for bash commands** - Just execute them directly, auto-accept will handle it
8. **ONLY ping if system actually blocks a command** - Don't preemptively ask for permission

### End of Turn Format
**Always end turns with this clear visual format:**
```

## üìö Claude Commands

### /recap
Read the CLAUDE.md file in the current project to understand the project context and my preferences.

### /chat
Just chat with me in conversational mode. Don't write any code unless I specifically ask. Keep responses in chat only.

When I ask about a problem or need help with something:
1. Always give me THREE different solutions or approaches
2. Tell me which one YOU think is best and explain why
3. Rank them like: ü•á Best, ü•à Good alternative, ü•â Quick & dirty

### /ui
When building or modifying UI, think like a designer. Start with reconnaissance, then apply thoughtful consistency.

**First, do your reconnaissance:**
- Look at 3-5 existing components for patterns
- Check the current spacing system (8px? 16px? 24px?)
- Find the button styles already in use (height, padding, border-radius)
- Identify the color variables/theme (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
- Note hover states, transitions, and animation patterns
- Check how the app handles responsive breakpoints

### /user-instructions
Generate user-friendly instructions for this app. Analyze ALL features and functionality, then create comprehensive guides that a non-technical person can follow.

### /test-console-logging
Always put test results and as much debugging info as possible in the browser console with clear formatting and emoji prefixes.

## üîß Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE** - Follow this exact order for every feature:

1. **Phase 1: Fast Unit Tests First** ‚ö°
   ```bash
   npm run test              # Unit tests (sub-second)
   npm run test:coverage     # Ensure >95% coverage
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Playwright E2E Integration** ü§ñ
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e         # Playwright full-app testing
   ```
   **ALWAYS RUN PLAYWRIGHT IN HEADLESS MODE** - Never use `--headed` flag unless explicitly debugging

3. **Phase 3: Manual Testing** üë§
   Only ask for manual testing when all automated tests pass 100%

### Automated Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL: Always test features before reporting completion**

1. **Default Testing Protocol**:
   ```bash
   # Always run Playwright tests in headless mode
   npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed=false
   
   # Take screenshots during tests for analysis
   await page.screenshot({ path: 'test-results/feature-name.png' })
   ```

2. **Before Telling User to Check**:
   - ‚úÖ Run full Playwright tests with screenshots
   - ‚úÖ Analyze screenshots for UI/UX issues:
     - Dark text on dark backgrounds
     - Missing elements
     - Layout problems
     - Mobile responsiveness
   - ‚úÖ Only report completion when confident it's correct
   - ‚ùå NEVER tell user to check unless tests pass

3. **Background Testing Only**:
   - Always use `headless: true` (default)
   - Never show anything on user's screen
   - Capture and analyze screenshots programmatically
   - Report issues found with evidence

4. **Common UI/UX Checks**:
   - Color contrast in light/dark modes
   - Text visibility and readability
   - Button states and interactions
   - Mobile viewport compatibility
   - Form input accessibility

### Running Development Servers

**THE ONLY CORRECT WAY TO RUN DEV SERVER:**
```bash
# Run in background so it stays alive
nohup npm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 & echo "Dev server started in background"

# Wait for it to start then verify
sleep 3 && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5173/ > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:5173/" || echo "‚ùå Server not responding"
```

**Access URLs (use 127.0.0.1 for VPN compatibility):**
- Main: http://127.0.0.1:5173/
- Test pages: http://127.0.0.1:5173/test/[name]

### Git Commit Management

**Proactively auto-commit when:**
1. Major feature complete
2. Planned goal achieved
3. Major bug fixes complete
4. Before switching contexts
5. After documentation updates
6. Before any destructive operations
7. After successful test runs

**Commit format:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[type]: Brief description

- Detail 1 of what changed
- Detail 2 of why it changed
- Any breaking changes or important notes

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature added
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### VPN + Localhost Development
If localhost isn't accessible while NordVPN is connected:
```bash
sudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains Wi-Fi "*.local" "169.254/16" "localhost" "127.0.0.1" "::1" "[::1]" "localhost:5173" "localhost:5174" "127.0.0.1:5173" "127.0.0.1:5174"
```

### Development Lessons Learned
1. **VPN + Localhost = Use 127.0.0.1**
2. **Keep Dev Server Running** - Don't interrupt with other commands
3. **Avoid Alpha/Beta Packages** - Use stable alternatives
4. **Handle Missing Environment Variables** - Add fallbacks
5. **Test Locally Before Deploying** - Always verify first
6. **Don't Interrupt Running Servers** - Use multiple terminals

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

### Settings Maintenance
When updating Claude Code permissions, ALWAYS update BOTH locations:
1. **User-level settings**: `~/.claude/settings.json` (applies to all projects)
2. **Project-level settings**: `.claude/settings.json` (applies to this project only)

### MCP Configuration
**Main Configuration File:** `/Users/calsmith/.claude.json`

**Current MCP Servers:**
1. **Context7** - Documentation search tool
2. **Supabase** - Database management tool

To update MCP servers:
```bash
# View current config
jq '.mcpServers' ~/.claude.json

# Restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
```
