## 🧠 Context for New Claude Session

### What We Just Accomplished (Phase 1c)
During Phase 1c, we didn't just extract PresenceService - we **fixed 3 critical bugs** that were breaking real-time translation:

1. **PresenceService Race Condition**: Fixed initialization bug where session IDs were reset to null
2. **Message Interface Mismatch**: Fixed `sendMessage()` → `queueMessage()` API calls  
3. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Aligned code with actual Supabase table structure

**Result**: End-to-end real-time translation now works flawlessly between devices!

### Current Architecture State
```
Components/
├── SessionTranslator (orchestrates all services)
└── SingleDeviceTranslator (reduced complexity)

Services/
├── ✅ MessageQueueService (Phase 1a) 
├── ✅ TranslationPipeline (Phase 1b)
├── ✅ PresenceService (Phase 1c) - WORKING PERFECTLY
└── MessageSyncService (1256 → 514 lines, still contains realtime logic)
```

### What's Left in MessageSyncService
The MessageSyncService is now 514 lines (down from 1256) but still contains:
- Supabase channel management and subscriptions
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff  
- Network resilience and connection state tracking
- Channel cleanup and subscription lifecycle

**This is exactly what Phase 1d targets for extraction!**

## 🎯 Phase 1d Mission

### Primary Objective
Extract **RealtimeConnection Service** to centralize all Supabase channel management:
- Move channel creation/destruction logic
- Extract reconnection and network resilience  
- Centralize connection state management
- Clean up subscription lifecycle patterns

### Expected Benefits
- **Debugging**: Network issues isolated to single service
- **Reusability**: Other services can use RealtimeConnection
- **Clarity**: MessageSyncService focuses only on message logic
- **Robustness**: Centralized reconnection strategy

### Architecture Target
```
Components/
├── SessionTranslator 
└── SingleDeviceTranslator

Services/
├── ✅ MessageQueueService
├── ✅ TranslationPipeline  
├── ✅ PresenceService
├── 🎯 RealtimeConnection ← NEW TARGET
└── MessageSyncService (simplified further)
```

## 📁 Key Documentation

### Must-Read Before Starting
1. **Phase 1d Spec**: `docs/refactor/phase-1d-realtime-connection.md`
2. **Current MessageSyncService**: `src/services/MessageSyncService.ts` (514 lines)
3. **Current PresenceService**: `src/services/presence/PresenceService.ts` (also uses Supabase channels)

### Reference Documentation
- **Refactor Overview**: `docs/refactor/README.md`
- **Phase 1c Lessons**: `docs/refactor/phase-1c-presence-service.md` (includes bug fixes)
- **Emergency Rollback**: `docs/refactor/EMERGENCY-ROLLBACK.md`

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Current Setup
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://127.0.0.1:5173)
- **Testing**: `npm test` for unit tests, `npx playwright test` for integration
- **VPN Compatibility**: Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost if using NordVPN

### Git State
- **Current Branch**: `phase-1b-rescue` (stable, all bugs fixed)
- **Recent Commits**: PresenceService fixes and schema alignment
- **Clean State**: Ready for Phase 1d development

### Testing Protocol
```bash
# 1. Run unit tests
npm test

# 2. Run integration tests  
npx playwright test tests/refactor/phase-1d-validation.spec.ts

# 3. Manual testing
# - Create session on two devices
# - Verify real-time messaging works
# - Test network disconnection/reconnection
```

## ⚠️ Critical Learnings from Phase 1c

### Bug Prevention Strategies
1. **Always check service initialization order** - Race conditions happen during startup
2. **Verify method names exist** - Interface mismatches cause runtime errors
3. **Check database schema** - Use Supabase MCP to verify actual table structure
4. **Test presence detection** - Partner online/offline is critical for UX

### Development Patterns That Work
- **Service extraction with dependency injection**
- **Deterministic channel naming** (avoid timestamps)
- **Clean subscription lifecycle** (unsubscribe + removeChannel)
- **Proper state management** (preserve session IDs during cleanup)

## 🎯 Phase 1d Success Criteria

Based on the spec document, Phase 1d should achieve:
- [ ] RealtimeConnection manages all Supabase channels
- [ ] Reconnection logic is centralized and robust  
- [ ] Clean subscription/unsubscription patterns
- [ ] Network resilience features work
- [ ] MessageSyncService becomes simpler
- [ ] All real-time features still work
- [ ] Connection state is easily observable

## 🧪 Testing Strategy for Phase 1d

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for RealtimeConnection service
- Integration tests for network resilience
- Regression tests to ensure no functionality breaks

### Manual Testing Focus
- **Network Disconnection**: Turn off WiFi during session
- **Reconnection**: Turn WiFi back on, verify automatic reconnection
- **Multi-Channel**: Ensure both message and presence channels work
- **Partner Detection**: Verify real-time presence still works perfectly

## 🚨 Known Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking PresenceService
- **Mitigation**: PresenceService also uses Supabase channels, coordinate carefully
- **Strategy**: Update PresenceService to use RealtimeConnection as dependency

### Risk: Message Sync Regression  
- **Mitigation**: We just fixed 3 critical bugs, don't reintroduce them
- **Strategy**: Preserve all existing MessageSyncService behavior during extraction

### Risk: Complex Reconnection Logic
- **Mitigation**: Current reconnection works, migrate it carefully
- **Strategy**: Move logic piece by piece, test at each step

## 🎉 Current App Status (What's Working)

### ✅ Confirmed Working Features
- **Session Creation**: 4-digit codes, host/guest roles
- **Partner Detection**: "Partner Online" shows correctly  
- **Activity Indicators**: Recording/processing/idle sync between devices
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages appear on both screens immediately
- **Translation Pipeline**: Whisper + GPT-4o-mini working perfectly
- **Network Resilience**: Offline queuing and retry logic
- **Database Integration**: Messages persist and sync correctly

### 🎯 Quality Metrics
- **Performance**: No regressions, same speed as before refactor
- **Reliability**: All critical race conditions fixed
- **User Experience**: Seamless real-time translation
- **Code Quality**: 59% reduction in MessageSyncService complexity
