# Session UI Feature

## Overview

The Session UI feature enables two users to connect their devices for real-time translation conversations. It builds on top of the single-device translator by adding a thin session management layer while reusing all existing components.

## User Experience

### Starting a Session

1. User clicks "Start Session" on the home screen
2. System generates a unique 4-digit code
3. User is navigated to the session translator
4. Session code is displayed prominently in the header
5. User shares the code with their conversation partner

### Joining a Session

1. User clicks "Join Session" on the home screen
2. User enters the 4-digit code received from the host
3. System validates the code and session availability
4. User is navigated to the session translator
5. Both users see connection status updates

### During a Session

- **Session Header**: Shows the 4-digit code, connection status, and partner online status
- **Translation Interface**: Identical to solo mode - all features work the same
- **Message Display**: User's messages appear on the right (standard chat pattern)
- **Language Detection**: Automatic, just like solo mode
- **Recording**: Same button, same visualization, same experience

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```
/session route
└── SessionTranslator
    ├── SessionHeader (new)
    │   ├── Code: 1234
    │   ├── Status: Connected
    │   └── Partner: Online
    └── SingleDeviceTranslator (reused)
        └── All existing functionality
```

### State Management

**Session State**:
- Stored in localStorage for persistence
- Passed via React Router navigation state
- Contains: sessionId, sessionCode, userId, role

**Message State**:
- Managed locally in Phase 2
- Each message tagged with session_id and user_id
- Ready for real-time sync in Phase 3

### Key Features

1. **Zero Learning Curve**: Interface is identical to solo mode
2. **Session Persistence**: Survives page refreshes
3. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
4. **Theme Support**: Respects light/dark mode preference
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for invalid sessions

## Visual Design

### Session Header
- Subtle blue background to distinguish from main content
- Compact height to maximize translation area
- Clear typography for the 4-digit code
- Status indicators with appropriate colors:
  - Yellow (pulsing): Connecting
  - Green: Connected
  - Red: Disconnected

### Mobile Adaptations
- Session header remains visible but compact
- All controls accessible with thumb reach
- Text remains readable at mobile sizes

## Error Scenarios

1. **Invalid Code**: Shows error message, remains on home screen
2. **Expired Session**: Appropriate error message
3. **Full Session**: Informs user session already has 2 participants
4. **Lost Connection**: Will show in header (Phase 3)
5. **No Session State**: Redirects to home screen

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Session state management
- Message handling
- Component integration
- Error scenarios

### E2E Tests
- Complete user flows
- Visual regression with screenshots
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark mode compatibility
- Session persistence

## Phase 2 Limitations

- No real-time synchronization (messages are local only)
- Connection status is simulated
- Partner online status is simulated
- No message history from before joining

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

- Real-time message synchronization
- Actual connection monitoring
- Message delivery indicators
- Typing indicators
- Reconnection handling
- Message history persistence
