# UI Contract Documentation

## üö® CRITICAL: User Interface Preservation Contract

This document establishes the **UI Contract** for the Real-time Translator v3 application. This contract **MUST** be preserved during all refactoring activities to prevent unauthorized UI changes.

## üìã Contract Overview

### Purpose
- **Prevent UI regression** during architectural refactoring
- **Maintain user experience** consistency across code changes
- **Enforce visual stability** through automated testing
- **Protect against scope creep** during refactoring tasks

### Scope
This contract covers all user-facing interfaces including:
- Solo translator mode (complete interface)
- Session translator mode (host and guest views)
- Home screen navigation
- All interactive elements and states
- Both light and dark theme variations
- Desktop and mobile responsive layouts

## üéØ UI Contract Rules

### 1. **ZERO UI CHANGES ALLOWED**
- No visual modifications during refactoring
- No layout changes or element repositioning
- No color scheme or theme adjustments
- No font size, spacing, or sizing changes
- No animation or transition modifications

### 2. **Pixel-Perfect Preservation**
- All UI elements must maintain exact positioning
- Button sizes, padding, and margins must remain identical
- Message bubbles, input fields, and interactive elements must look identical
- Audio visualization and activity indicators must render identically

### 3. **Functional Preservation**
- All interactive elements must work exactly as before
- Navigation flows must remain unchanged
- User input patterns must be preserved
- Error states and loading states must appear identical

### 4. **Theme Consistency**
- Light and dark modes must render identically to baselines
- Theme switching must work exactly as before
- All color contrasts and accessibility features must be preserved

### 5. **Responsive Behavior**
- Mobile layouts must match baseline screenshots
- Desktop layouts must match baseline screenshots
- Breakpoint behavior must remain consistent

## üì∏ Baseline Screenshots

### Location
All baseline screenshots are stored in:
```
tests/visual-regression/screenshots/
```

### Coverage
The baseline includes screenshots for:

#### Solo Translator Mode
- `solo-light-desktop.png` - Light theme, desktop viewport
- `solo-dark-desktop.png` - Dark theme, desktop viewport
- `solo-light-mobile.png` - Light theme, mobile viewport
- `solo-dark-mobile.png` - Dark theme, mobile viewport
- `solo-with-messages-light.png` - With message bubbles displayed
- `solo-recording-light.png` - During audio recording state

#### Session Translator Mode
- `session-creation-light-desktop.png` - Session creation screen
- `session-join-light-desktop.png` - Session join screen
- `session-host-with-partner-light.png` - Host view with partner connected
- `session-guest-with-partner-light.png` - Guest view with partner connected

#### Home Screen
- `home-light-desktop.png` - Home screen, light theme, desktop
- `home-dark-desktop.png` - Home screen, dark theme, desktop
- `home-light-mobile.png` - Home screen, light theme, mobile

#### Component States
- `language-selector-states.png` - Language dropdown states
- `translation-mode-toggles.png` - Translation mode button states
- `error-state-network.png` - Network error display

#### Validation
- `ui-validation-solo.png` - Primary validation screenshot for regression detection

## üîß Enforcement Tools

### NPM Scripts
```bash
# Take baseline screenshots (run before refactoring)
npm run ui:baseline

# Validate UI preservation (run during/after refactoring)
npm run ui:validate

# Full visual regression test suite
npm run test:visual

# Update screenshots (only for intentional UI changes)
npm run test:visual:update

# Debug visual differences
npm run test:visual:debug

# Generate visual regression report
npm run test:visual:report
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Automatically run UI validation before commits
- Prevent commits with UI regressions
- Require manual override for intentional UI changes

### Continuous Integration
- All PRs must pass visual regression tests
- Screenshots differences trigger build failures
- Manual approval required for UI changes

## üìù Validation Process

### Before Refactoring
1. **Establish Baseline**
   ```bash
   npm run ui:baseline
   ```

2. **Commit Baseline**
   ```bash
   git add tests/visual-regression/screenshots/
   git commit -m "docs: establish UI baseline before refactoring"
   ```

### During Refactoring
1. **Regular Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run after each significant change
   npm run ui:validate
   ```

2. **Fix Regressions Immediately**
   - Any screenshot differences must be addressed
   - Revert changes if UI is accidentally modified
   - Only proceed when all screenshots match

### After Refactoring
1. **Final Validation**
   ```bash
   npm run test:visual
   ```

2. **Generate Report**
   ```bash
   npm run test:visual:report
   ```

## üö® Violation Response

### If UI Regressions Are Detected

1. **STOP ALL WORK** - Do not proceed with refactoring
2. **Identify the Change** - Use visual diff tools to see what changed
3. **Assess Intent** - Determine if change was intentional or accidental

### For Accidental Changes
1. **Revert Immediately** - Undo changes that caused regression
2. **Re-validate** - Ensure UI is restored to baseline
3. **Continue Refactoring** - Proceed only after validation passes

### For Intentional Changes
1. **Get Approval** - Confirm UI changes are authorized
2. **Update Documentation** - Document the UI change rationale
3. **Update Baselines** - Run `npm run ui:baseline` to update screenshots
4. **Commit Changes** - Include both code and screenshot updates

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Updating Baselines
Only update baseline screenshots when:
- UI changes are explicitly requested and approved
- New features require additional UI elements
- Bug fixes require visual corrections
- Accessibility improvements are implemented

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly review of UI contract compliance
- Quarterly update of screenshot coverage
- Annual review of contract effectiveness

## üìä Contract Metrics

### Success Indicators
- **Zero unauthorized UI changes** during refactoring
- **100% visual regression test coverage** for critical paths
- **Automated enforcement** prevents UI drift
- **Fast detection** of accidental UI modifications

### Monitoring
- Track UI regression detection rate
- Monitor false positive rates in visual tests
- Measure time to detect UI changes
- Assess developer compliance with contract

## üéØ Benefits

### For Development
- **Confidence in refactoring** - No fear of breaking UI
