### Q: Do I need to download an app?
**A:** Nope! It works directly in your web browser. You can optionally "Add to Home Screen" on mobile for an app-like experience, but it's not required.

### Q: What devices work with this?
**A:** Any device with a web browser and microphone:
- 📱 **Mobile**: iPhone, Android phones and tablets
- 💻 **Desktop**: Windows, Mac, Linux computers

## 🎤 Voice & Audio

### Q: Why isn't my microphone working?
**A:** Most common solutions:
1. **Click record first** - Permission is only requested when you first try to record
2. **Grant permission** - Click "Allow" when the browser asks for microphone access
3. **Check settings** - Look for the 🔒 icon in your address bar and enable microphone
4. **Try different browser** - Chrome usually works best
5. **Restart browser** - Close and reopen your browser completely

### Q: The audio quality is poor. How can I improve it?
**A:** Try these tips:
- 🎯 **Speak clearly** and at normal speed
- 🤫 **Find a quiet space** - background noise affects quality
- 🎧 **Use headphones** with a microphone if possible
- 📱 **Hold phone closer** to your mouth (but not too close)
- 🔄 **Check internet** - slow connections affect audio quality

### Q: Can I use this with headphones/earbuds?
**A:** Absolutely! Bluetooth headphones, wired earbuds, or any microphone setup works great. Sometimes they provide better audio quality than your device's built-in microphone.

### Q: Does it work on phone calls or video chats?
**A:** This app is designed for direct conversations, not for adding translation to existing calls. For phone/video calls, you'd both need to be in the same translation session.

### Q: Why does the app only ask for permission when I record?
**A:** We respect your privacy! The app doesn't access your microphone until you actively choose to record. This means:
- No permission prompts when you first open the app
- Microphone only activates when you tap record
- Permission is remembered after the first time
- Better battery life since we're not constantly listening

## 🌍 Languages & Translation

### Q: What languages are supported?
**A:** Currently supports:
- 🇺🇸 **English** 
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish (Español)**
- 🇧🇷 **Portuguese (Português)**

More languages are planned for future updates!

### Q: How accurate are the translations?
**A:** Very accurate for conversational speech! The AI:
- ✅ **Understands context** from your conversation
- ✅ **Fixes speech errors** like "um" and "uh"  
- ✅ **Uses natural language** rather than word-for-word translation
- ✅ **Learns from context** - mentions earlier topics for better accuracy

### Q: Can I choose which language to translate to?
**A:** Yes! Use the language selector to choose Spanish or Portuguese as your target. English speakers will see translations in your chosen language, and Spanish/Portuguese speakers will see English translations.

### Q: Why do some translations seem weird?
**A:** A few possible reasons:
- 🎤 **Audio wasn't clear** - try speaking more clearly
- 🌐 **Complex phrases** - try simpler words or rephrase
- 📚 **Technical terms** - consider typing technical words instead
- 🔄 **No context** - AI works better with conversation flow

### Q: Can it translate text messages or emails?
**A:** The app is designed for real-time conversations. While you can type text to translate, it works best for conversational exchanges rather than documents or formal text.

## 👥 Sessions & Groups

### Q: How do sessions work?
**A:** Sessions are like chat rooms:
- 🎯 **4-digit codes** (like 1234) identify each session
- ⏰ **Last 4 hours** then automatically expire
- 👥 **Multiple people** can join the same session
- 🔄 **Real-time sync** - everyone sees translations instantly

### Q: How many people can join one session?
**A:** There's no hard limit, but sessions work best with 2-6 people. Too many people talking at once can get confusing since the app works best when people take turns speaking.

### Q: What happens after 4 hours?
**A:** Sessions automatically expire and all messages are deleted. This is for privacy - no conversations are stored permanently. Just create a new session to continue.

### Q: Can I save my conversation history?
**A:** Currently, conversations are automatically deleted after 4 hours for privacy. Export/save features may be added in future updates.

### Q: Someone is being inappropriate in my session. What can I do?
**A:** Since sessions are temporary and anonymous:
- 🚪 **Leave immediately** - just close the browser tab
- 🆕 **Create new session** - start fresh with a new code
- 📞 **Contact support** - report serious issues to help improve the service

## 📱 Mobile & Technical

### Q: Why does it keep asking for microphone permission?
**A:** The app should only ask once. If it keeps asking:
- 🕵️ **Using private browsing** - try regular browser mode
- 🔄 **Browser cache issues** - clear browser data and try again
- ⚙️ **System settings** - check your phone's microphone settings
- 🌐 **Different browsers** - some browsers handle permissions differently

### Q: Does it work better on iPhone or Android?
**A:** Both work great! The app uses advanced techniques to ensure:
- ✅ **Perfect iOS Safari support** - no audio context issues
- ✅ **Fast Android Chrome** - optimized for all Android devices
- ✅ **Instant recording** - starts immediately on both platforms
- ✅ **No repeated permissions** - asks only once on first use

### Q: The app is slow or laggy. What's wrong?
**A:** Speed depends on several factors:
- 📶 **Internet connection** - slow internet = slower translations
- 🔋 **Device performance** - older devices may be slower
- 👥 **Server load** - busy times may be slower
- 🌍 **Distance to servers** - farther away = slightly slower

The app automatically adjusts quality based on your connection speed.

### Q: Does it work offline?
**A:** Basic app functions work offline, but translation requires an internet connection since it uses cloud-based AI services. You can't translate without internet.

### Q: Is my data secure and private?
**A:** Yes! Your privacy is protected:
- 🗑️ **Auto-deletion** - all conversations deleted after 4 hours
- 🔒 **No permanent storage** - we don't keep your translations
- 👤 **Anonymous** - no accounts or personal info required
- 🔐 **Encrypted** - all communication is secure

### Q: Can I use this on my work computer?
**A:** Usually yes, but some company firewalls might block microphone access or certain websites. Check with your IT department if you have issues.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

**A:** Follow these tips:
- 🗣️ **Speak naturally** - don't slow down artificially

- 🔄 **Rephrase if needed** - try different words if translation seems off

- 🎯 **Complex terms** (technical words, names, addresses)
- 📱 **Phone issues** (microphone problems, poor audio quality)

### Q: How do I share a session with others?
**A:** Super easy:
1. Create a session and note your 4-digit code
2. Share that code with others (text, email, write it down)
3. They go to the website and choose "Join Session"
4. They enter your code and you're connected!
